# Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse and Voice Assistant  
### Hands-Free Interaction for Enhanced User Experience

## 🧠 Overview
This project introduces an AI-powered, hands-free human–computer interaction system that combines **gesture recognition** and **voice commands**. It allows users to control their computer using **hand gestures** detected via a webcam and **speech commands** for system operations, eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.

## 🚀 Features
- 🖐️ **Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse** – Move cursor, click, drag, and scroll using hand gestures captured by a webcam.  
- 🎙️ **Voice Assistant** – Execute commands like opening applications, searching online, or controlling system functions using speech.  
- ⚙️ **Real-Time Detection** – Smooth and responsive performance using OpenCV and MediaPipe.  
- 🧩 **Accessible and Inclusive** – Helps physically challenged users operate computers effortlessly.  
- 💻 **Cross-Platform Support** – Works on most systems with Python, webcam, and microphone.
